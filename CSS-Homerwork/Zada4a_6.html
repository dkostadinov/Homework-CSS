			<p>As in the 2 column exercise,the color change is detectible where the div meets the .jpg background.
			I used the  same hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
			
			<p>This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip.I get serious Float Drop when I resize
			(reduce) the browser window.I think that is what "display:inline;/* stops IE doubling margin on float" 
			is for,but  would like further explaination to understand this comment.</p>
			
			<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessery in a stylesheet if there is also going to be seperate version wrappers 
			as  we have here to contain the different background images?Or perhaps this is an example of an inner div
			as the  book suggests?I am still confused on that detail. </p>
			
			<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div,the page still huggs the left side?I've tried it in
			all of them,but it won't budge?</p>
			
			<p>Obviously,this footer has a mind of it's own...it's in the wrapper,but the "clear" seems to be allowing it
			outside. However,when I remove the clear,it hugs the bottom of the header?</p>
